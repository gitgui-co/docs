## Why GitGUI?

GitGUI is built for developers who want the **power of Git** without the **complexity of the command line** or the **bloat of enterprise tools**.

<div class="features-grid">

### Lightweight & Fast
No Electron bloat here. GitGUI launches instantly and stays responsive even with large repositories.

### One-Time Payment
Pay once, own it forever. Includes **3 years of updates** with no recurring fees or subscriptions.

### Privacy First
Voice recognition runs entirely on your machine using a local Whisper model. Your code and commits never leave your computer.

### Keyboard-Driven
Every action has a shortcut. `Alt+O` to switch repos, `Ctrl+S` to stage all, `Alt+1-4` for commit prefixes. Work without touching your mouse.

</div>

## Perfect For

- **Solo developers** who want a visual overview of their work
- **Teams** who need to quickly review branch histories
- **Open source contributors** managing multiple repositories
- **Anyone** tired of typing `git log --oneline --graph --all` over and over
