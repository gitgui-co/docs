## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens after 3 years?

After your 3-year update period ends, GitGUI continues to work forever. You just won't receive new features or updates. You can optionally purchase an update extension at a discounted rate.

### Can I use GitGUI on multiple computers?

Yes! Your license works on up to **3 devices** that you personally own and use. Perfect for your desktop, laptop, and home office setup.

### Is there a free trial?

We don't offer a free trial, but we do offer a **30-day money-back guarantee**. If GitGUI isn't right for you, email us for a full refund, no questions asked.

### Do you offer team licenses?

Not yet, but we're working on it! For now, each team member needs their own license. Contact us at **sales@gitgui.co** for volume discounts on 5+ licenses.

### What payment methods do you accept?

We accept all major credit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay through our secure Stripe checkout.

### Is my payment secure?

Absolutely. We use Stripe for payment processing. We never see or store your credit card details.

### Do I need an internet connection?

Only for initial activation. After that, GitGUI works completely offline. The voice recognition feature also runs locally on your machine.
