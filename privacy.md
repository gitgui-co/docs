# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2026**

GitGUI ("us", "we", or "our") operates the GitGUI desktop application (the "Software"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Software.

## Our Commitment to Privacy

**GitGUI is designed with privacy as a core principle.** Your code, commits, and repository data never leave your computer. We believe your development work is your business, not ours.

## Information We Collect

### License Validation
When you activate your license, we collect:
- **License key** - To verify your purchase
- **Machine identifier** - A hashed, anonymous identifier to enforce the 3-device limit
- **Activation timestamp** - To track your update eligibility period

This information is transmitted securely via HTTPS and stored on our servers.

### What We Do NOT Collect
- ❌ Your source code
- ❌ Your commit messages
- ❌ Your repository contents
- ❌ Your file names or paths
- ❌ Your Git history
- ❌ Voice recordings (processed entirely on-device)
- ❌ Usage analytics or telemetry
- ❌ Crash reports (unless you explicitly send them)

## Voice Recognition

GitGUI includes voice-to-text functionality for commit messages. This feature:
- Uses a **local Whisper AI model** that runs entirely on your device
- **Never transmits audio** to any server
- **Does not store recordings** - audio is processed in memory and immediately discarded
- Works completely **offline** after initial model download
